Summary:

Update: 
The game will start as the player watches tv and he sees on the news the casualties that plastic waste is causing around the world(maybe only in groningen) That motivates him to participate in world clean-up day Groningen. 

Some ideas: 

Split screen co-op(if doable) player 1 and player 2 will cooperate to clean the area of the plastic waste. The areas will be alleys, beach, park and more. The area  will be finished when the players reach 100% clean-up. At the end - the display will show the scores of the players( it will show who did better and hopefuly will motivate them to do better on the next level)





Another material that is same as plastic but it decomposes in water as well as it’s harmless for people and the nature - link

Ideas how to implement it:

We can add it as a question to the questionnaire where the question can be: “Did you know that a material such as plastic that has the same strong qualities as it but it’s totally harmless for the people and nature?” 
Of course, this program is still brand new and it will take a few years to spread over the world.

Another idea how to use this information is by putting it in the end screen of the game just to make people aware.


Another thing we can implement in our game or questionnaire is with this game.
Basically it’s a suggestion game where you give your ideas on how long it will take for different types of trash to dissolve.

Story: 
Tl;dr: You join a world cleanup organization that aims to clean up the world (shocker). You start as a low ranking member, but as you contribute to the cleaning of various locations you rise up the ranks, learn more about how to help clean the world, and achieve the goal of cleaning up the world (clean up the world, how many more times can I say it)
Start:
